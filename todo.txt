 - [ ] Serializing Data
    - [ ] Store everything in ./sentiment-files/<TERM>/
    - [ ] That dir contains scores-raw.pkl and scores-avg.pkl
    - [ ] scores-raw.pkl should contain:
        - [ ] Each post that contributes to the score, indexed by the day it was posted,
        - [ ] The sentiment score for each of those posts
    - [ ] scores-avg.pkl should contain:
        - [ ] The average sentiment score by day for each day in the last 365 days
        - [ ] This score should be smoothed over multiple days (making sure to weight days by # of posts on that day)
 - [ ] Updating Sentiment
    - [ ] There should be a universal update function that keeps track of all the terms
    - [ ] When this function is run, for each term, it should:
        - [ ] Fetch 100 Reddit posts from search
        - [ ] Add them into the relevant scores-raw.pkl if they're not already included
        - [ ] Recompute the last 365 days of average sentiment scores in scores-avg.pkl
 - [ ] Other Utility Functions
    - [ ] Function to add a new term to track (T/F parameter if it should populate it with 100 Reddit posts right away)
    - [ ] Function to get the current avg sentiment index for a particular term
